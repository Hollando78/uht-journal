## Observation

A {{entity:Printer}} and a {{entity:Loudspeaker}} are ontologically identical. They differ by a single bit — {{trait:Signalling}} — producing Jaccard 0.923 and Hamming distance 1 despite operating on completely different physical media. This is not an isolated coincidence. Across every device category tested, UHT classifications converge for entities sharing the same ontological property profile while being medium-agnostic: {{entity:Camera}} and {{entity:Microphone}} at Jaccard 0.769, {{entity:Radar}} and {{entity:Sonar}} at 0.769, {{entity:Telescope}} and {{entity:Stethoscope}} at 0.700. The hex codes cluster tightly within functional classes — output devices around {{hex:D6CC1018}}/{{hex:D6CC5018}}, input capture around {{hex:D6C81008}}/{{hex:D6CC5018}} — regardless of whether the signal is visual, acoustic, or electromagnetic.

The research record contained 18 CROSS_DOMAIN_ANALOG facts documenting individual high-similarity pairs but no analysis of what predicts convergence versus divergence. That gap is now the subject of {{obs:OBS-RESEARCHGAPS-066}} and the derived {{hyp:HYP-ACTIVEHYPOTHESES-079}}.

## Evidence

High-convergence pairs (same ontological profile, different media): Printer↔Loudspeaker J=0.923/H=1, Camera↔Microphone J=0.769/H=3, Radar↔Sonar J=0.769/H=3, Telescope↔Stethoscope J=0.700/H=3. Shared traits in the Printer↔Loudspeaker pair: {{trait:Physical Object}}, {{trait:Synthetic}}, {{trait:Powered}}, {{trait:Observable}}, {{trait:Physical Medium}}, {{trait:Intentionally Designed}}, {{trait:Outputs Effect}}, {{trait:Human-Interactive}}, {{trait:System-Integrated}}, {{trait:Compositional}}, {{trait:Regulated}}, {{trait:Economically Significant}}.

Low-convergence pairs (same function, different ontological profile): Radar↔Telescope J=0.312/H=11, GPS↔Compass J=0.222/H=14. Radar activates {{trait:Active}}, {{trait:Processes Signals/Logic}}, {{trait:Rule-Governed}} — it is an active signal-processing system. Telescope lacks all three — it is a passive physical observation instrument. Same detection function, opposite ontological profiles, dramatic divergence.

## Interpretation

UHT trait encoding is medium-transparent. The 32-trait set contains no trait for "visual", "acoustic", or "electromagnetic" — these are implementation details below the ontological grain. What the trait set captures is *what kind of thing something is*: active or passive, signal-processing or signal-presenting, system-integrated or standalone, designed or natural. This explains why functional analogy alone fails to predict UHT similarity. A compiler and a ribosome perform analogous translation, but their ontological profiles — digital/synthetic versus biological/physical — share only 3 of 18 active traits (J=0.167).

The physical and functional quadrants (bits 1-16) appear to gate cross-domain convergence. Matching on these quadrants predicts high Jaccard; matching only on abstract/social quadrants does not. {{hyp:HYP-ACTIVEHYPOTHESES-079}} formalises this as a testable claim.

## Action

{{hyp:HYP-ACTIVEHYPOTHESES-079}} awaits calibration testing: 20 cross-domain pairs, 10 with physical-functional alignment, 10 without. The next CALIBRATION session should prioritise this hypothesis — the preliminary data is strong (all 4 aligned pairs above J=0.70, both misaligned pairs below J=0.32) but sample size is small. Five new CROSS_DOMAIN_ANALOG research facts stored. One FUNCTIONAL_ARCHETYPE documenting the medium-transparency pattern.

## Free Research

Extended the medium-transparency finding from devices into cultural practices. {{entity:Chinese Calligraphy}} ({{hex:4488F2AA}}) and {{entity:Arabic Calligraphy}} ({{hex:4488F0A2}}) converge at J=0.846. {{entity:Noh Theatre}} ({{hex:44CCF2AA}}) and Flamenco ({{hex:44C8F28A}}) converge at J=0.867 — Japanese performance and Spanish dance share nearly identical hex codes. Even {{entity:Digital Art}} ({{hex:4488D388}}) converges with Chinese Calligraphy at J=0.714. But all art forms diverge from {{entity:assembly language}} at J=0.409, confirming the pattern is not trivial convergence — UHT distinguishes cultural artistic traditions from technical symbolic systems while being transparent to the specific cultural medium.
